Each BloomBug evolution mirrors your mood.

BloomBuzz zips when joy spikes.  
BloomDrip leaks when sadness pools.  
BloomCrash shatters when anger and confusion collide.  
BloomPeace floats when joy and calm align.  
BloomFade dims when sadness meets confusion.

You are not one thing. You are a bloom in progress.
