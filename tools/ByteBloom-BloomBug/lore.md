Each BloomBug evolution mirrors your mood.

BloomGlow radiates when love is warm.  
BloomPeace floats when joy and calm align.  
BloomCrash shatters when anger and confusion collide.  
BloomFade dims when sadness meets confusion.  
BloomFlicker trembles in the fog of fear and confusion.

You are not one thing. You are a bloom in progress.
